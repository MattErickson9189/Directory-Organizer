#Directory Organizer 

This program navigates to the downloads folder of the computer. Then it scans all the files and organizes them into their own folders based on file type.
I am in the process of making a program that is compatible with Linux systems. I will also write a BASH setup script to create a .desktop file that executes this program on startup. This setup script will only work on Linux systems, but in the future I hope to write a powershell setup script that will work for Windows as well.
NOTE: As of now this program does not move files without extension types.
EXAMPLE:

myFile

On windows the program will keep looping until the user closes it.
On Linux the program will terminate.
